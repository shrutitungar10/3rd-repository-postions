        <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        -It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.<br>
        -The main advantages are separation of content (in HTML) and styling (in CSS) and the same CSS rules can be used across all pages and not have to be rewritten.<br>
        -HTML uses tags and CSS uses rule sets.<br>
        -CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.<br>

        <b>Why CSS?</b><br><br>
        Saves Time: Write CSS once and reuse it across multiple HTML pages.<br>
        Easy Maintenance: Change the style globally with a single modification.<br>
        Search Engine Friendly: Clean coding technique that improves readability for search engines.<br>
        Superior Styles: Offers a wider array of attributes compared to HTML.<br>
        Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally using offline cache, allowing offline viewing.</p>
        <p>
        <b>CSS Syntax</b><br><br>
        CSS consists of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and applied to the corresponding elements.<br>A style rule set includes a selector and a declaration block.
         Selector: Targets specific HTML elements to apply styles.<br>
         Declaration: Combination of a property and its corresponding value.<br>
